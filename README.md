### Browser Extensions

we haven't made our own yet!

## Getting Started

#### Chrome


+ Build Your Own - Get the code as explained below and issue `npx gulp chromium`. Then open
Chrome, go to `Tools > Extension` and load the (unpackaged) extension from the
directory `build/chromium`.

## Getting the Code

To get a local copy of the current code, clone it using git:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mozilla/AriaPDF.git
    $ cd pdf.js

Next, install Node.js via the [official package](https://nodejs.org) or via
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). If everything worked out, install
all dependencies for AriaPDF:

    $ npm install

Finally, you need to start a local web server as some browsers do not allow opening
PDF files using a `file://` URL. Run:

    $ npx gulp server

and then you can open:

+ http://localhost:8888/web/viewer.html

Please keep in mind that this assumes the latest version of Mozilla Firefox; refer to [Building PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/README.md#building-pdfjs) for non-development usage of the PDF.js library.

It is also possible to view all test PDF files on the right side by opening:

+ http://localhost:8888/test/pdfs/?frame

## Building AriaPDF

In order to bundle all `src/` files into two production scripts and build the generic
viewer, run:

    $ npx gulp generic

If you need to support older browsers, run:

    $ npx gulp generic-legacy

This will generate `pdf.js` and `pdf.worker.js` in the `build/generic/build/` directory (respectively `build/generic-legacy/build/`).
Both scripts are needed but only `pdf.js` needs to be included since `pdf.worker.js` will
be loaded by `pdf.js`. The PDF.js files are large and should be minified for production.
